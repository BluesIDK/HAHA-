      "The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federal union of 50 states and Washington, D.C. as its federal capital district. The 48 contiguous states border Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, with the semi-exclavic state of Alaska in the northwest and the archipelagic state of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five major island territories and various uninhabited islands.[k] It is a megadiverse country, with the world's third-largest land area[d] and third-largest population, exceeding 340 million.[l] Its three largest metropolitan areas are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and its three most populous states are California, Texas, and Florida.\n",
      "Paleo-Indians migrated to North America across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations and societies. Spanish exploration and colonization led to the establishment in 1513 of Spanish Florida, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. France also began to colonize at this time, but major settlements came much later. Subsequent British colonization led to the first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Intensive agriculture in the rapidly expanding Southern Colonies encouraged the forced migration of enslaved Africans. Clashes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress formally declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the 1775â€“1783 Revolutionary War, the country continued to expand westward across North America, resulting in the dispossession of native inhabitants. As more states were admitted,[m] a Northâ€“South division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the Union in the 1861â€“1865 American Civil War. With the victory and preservation of the United States, slavery was abolished nationally. By the late 19th century, the country had established itself as a great power, a status solidified after its involvement in World War I. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Its aftermath left the U.S. and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries struggled for ideological dominance and international influence. The Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War in 1991 left the U.S. as the world's sole superpower, with significant geopolitical influence globally.\n",
      "The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population, and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. The country's Democratic and Republican parties have dominated American politics since the 1850s. Federalism provides substantial autonomy to the 50 states, while American values are based on a democratic political tradition that draws its inspiration from the European Enlightenment movement.\n",
      "One of the world's most developed countries, the U.S. ranks among the highest in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, and higher education. The United States accounted for over a quarter of nominal global economic output in 2024, and its economy has been the world's largest by nominal GDP since about 1890. It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household income per capita among OECD countries, though U.S. wealth inequality is higher than in most other developed countries. The U.S. is a member of multiple international organizations and plays a leading role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Etymology ###\n",
      "The first documented use of the phrase \"United States of America\" is a letter from January 2, 1776. Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, wrote to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp, seeking to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[20][21] The first known public usage is an anonymous essay published in the Williamsburg newspaper, The Virginia Gazette, on AprilÂ 6, 1776.[20][22][23] By June 1776, the \"United States of America\" appeared in the Articles of Confederation,[24][25] and in July, the Declaration of Independence.[24] The Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.[26]\n",
      "The term \"United States\" and the initialism \"U.S.\", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism \"USA\", a noun, is also common.[27] \"United States\" and \"U.S.\" are the established terms throughout the U.S. federal government, with prescribed rules.[n] \"The States\" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad;[29] \"stateside\" is the corresponding adjective or adverb.[30]\n",
      "\"America\" is the feminine form of the first word of Americus Vesputius, the Latinized name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454â€“1512); it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller and Matthias Ringmann in 1507.[31][o] Vespucci first proposed that the West Indies discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia.[32][33][34] In English, the term \"America\" rarely refers to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of \"the Americas\" to describe the totality of North and South America.[35]\n",

      "### Indigenous peoples ###\n",
      "The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia over 12,000 years ago, either across the Bering land bridge or along the now-submerged Ice Age coastline.[37][38] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[39][40] Over time, indigenous North American cultures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[41] In the post-archaic period, the Mississippian cultures were located in the midwestern, eastern, and southern regions, and the Algonquian in the Great Lakes region and along the Eastern Seaboard, while the Hohokam culture and Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the southwest.[42] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[43][44] to nearly 10 million.[44][45]\n",
      "\n",
      "### European exploration, colonization and conflict (1513â€“1765) ###\n",
      "Christopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean for Spain in 1492, leading to Spanish-speaking settlements and missions from Puerto Rico and Florida to New Mexico and California. The first Spanish colony in what is now the continental United States was Spanish Florida, chartered in 1513.[46][47][48][49] After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, Saint Augustine, was founded in 1565.[50] France established its own settlements in French Florida in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids (Fort Caroline, 1565); permanent French settlements would be founded much later along the Great Lakes (Fort Detroit, 1701), the Mississippi River (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the Gulf of Mexico (New Orleans, 1718).[51] Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of New Nederland (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of New Sweden (settled 1638 in what is now Delaware). British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and the Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts, 1620).[52][53] The Mayflower Compact in Massachusetts and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[54][55] While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[56][p] Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity.[60][61] Along the eastern seaboard, settlers trafficked African slaves through the Atlantic slave trade.[62]\n",
      "The original Thirteen Colonies[q] that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of Great Britain,[63] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[64][65] The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations;[66] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[67] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[68] and the First Great Awakening, a series of Christian revivals, fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[69]\n",
      "\n",
      "### American Revolution and the early republic (1765â€“1800) ###\n",
      "Following their victory in the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their rights as Englishmen, particularly the right to representation in the British government that taxed them. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the First Continental Congress met in 1774 and passed the Continental Association, a colonial boycott of British goods that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and created a committee that named Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence. Two days after passing the Lee Resolution to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776.[70] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[71] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and all hereditary political power; civic virtue; and vilification of political corruption.[72] The Founding Fathers of the United States, who included Washington, Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and many others, were inspired by Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and Enlightenment philosophies and ideas.[73][74]\n",
      "The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were ratified in 1781 and established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[70] After the British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781 American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[75] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[76] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a federal republic governed by three separate branches that together ensured a system of checks and balances.[77] George Washington was elected the country's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.[78][79] His resignation as commander-in-chief after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the peaceful transfer of power.[80][81]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Westward expansion and Civil War (1800â€“1865) ###\n",
      "The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[82][83] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[84][85] Spain ceded Florida and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[86] In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, many with a sense of manifest destiny.[87][88] The Missouri Compromise of 1820, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. The compromise further prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36Â°30â€² parallel.[89] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[90][91] The most significant removal legislation in U.S. history was the Indian Removal Act of 1830. It culminated in the Trail of Tears (1830â€“1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the Mississippi River were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, resulting in anywhere from 13,200 to 16,700 deaths.[92] These and earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi.[93][94] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[95] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[96] Victory in the Mexicanâ€“American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California, Nevada, Utah, and much of present-day Colorado and the American Southwest.[87][97] The California gold rush of 1848â€“1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the California genocide of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[98] just as additional western territories and states were created.[99]\n",
      "During the colonial period, slavery had been legal in the American colonies, especially in the agriculture-intensive Southern Colonies from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[100] Spurred by an active abolitionist movement that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in the North enacted anti-slavery laws.[101] At the same time, support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states with inventions such as the cotton gin (1793), which had long made the institution profitable for Southern elites.[102][103][104] Throughout the 1850s, this sectional conflict regarding slavery was further inflamed by legislation in Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court: The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 mandated the return of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states to their owners in the South. The Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise.[105] Finally, in its Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory and declared the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These events exacerbated tensions between North and South that would culminate in the American Civil War (1861â€“1865).[106][107] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the other states remained in the Union.[108][109] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederates bombarded Fort Sumter.[110][111] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union army.[112] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[113] The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[114]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Postâ€“Civil War era (1865â€“1917) ###\n",
      "From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[117] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York City and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[118] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[119] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[120]\n",
      "The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[121][122] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[123][124] A series of Supreme Court decisions, including Plessy v. Ferguson, emptied the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing Jim Crow laws in the South to remain unchecked, sundown towns in the Midwest, and segregation in communities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of redlining later adopted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation.[125]\n",
      "An explosion of technological advancement accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[126] led to rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined.[127][128] This fostered the amassing of power by a few prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[129] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[130] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, creating the environment for labor unions and socialist movements to begin to flourish.[131][132][133] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[134][135]\n",
      "Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. That same year, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam were ceded to the U.S. by Spain after the latter's defeat in the Spanishâ€“American War. (The Philippines was granted full independence from the U.S. on July 4, 1946, following World War II. Puerto Rico and Guam have remained U.S. territories.)[136] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[137] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[138]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rise as a superpower (1917â€“1945) ###\n",
      "The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[139] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[140] During the 1920s and '30s, radio for mass communication and the invention of early television transformed communications nationwide.[141] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with the New Deal, a series of sweeping programs and public works projects combined with financial reforms and regulations. All were intended to protect against future economic depressions.[142][143]\n",
      "Initially neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[144][145] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[146][147] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the post-war world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[148][149] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic power and international political influence.[150]\n",

      "After World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate world affairs.[151][152][153] The U.S. utilized the policy of containment to limit the USSR's sphere of influence, engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with Moscow, and prevailed in the Space Race, which culminated with the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[154][155] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[156] The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[157] The Great Society plan of President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and a constitutional amendment to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering institutional racism.[158] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward recreational drug use and sexuality.[159][160] It also encouraged open defiance of the military draft (leading to the end of conscription in 1973) and wide opposition to U.S. intervention in Vietnam (with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975).[161] A societal shift in the roles of women was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of American women aged 16 and older were employed.[162] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the fall of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and left the United States as the world's sole superpower.[163][164][165][166]\n",

      "### Contemporary (1991â€“present) ###\n",
      "The 1990s saw the longest recorded economic expansion in American history, a dramatic decline in U.S. crime rates, and advances in technology. Throughout this decade, technological innovations such as the World Wide Web, the evolution of the Pentium microprocessor in accordance with Moore's law, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the first gene therapy trial, and cloning either emerged in the U.S. or were improved upon there. The Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990, while Nasdaq became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.[167]\n",
      "In the Gulf War of 1991, an American-led international coalition of states expelled an Iraqi invasion force that had occupied neighboring Kuwait.[168] The September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 by the pan-Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda led to the war on terror, and subsequent military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[169][170]\n",
      "The U.S. housing bubble culminated in 2007 with the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[171] Coming to a head in the 2010s, political polarization in the country increased between liberal and conservative factions.[172][173][174] This polarization was capitalized upon in the January 2021 Capitol attack,[175] when a mob of insurrectionists[176] entered the U.S. Capitol and sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power[177] in an attempted self-coup d'Ã©tat.[178] In Mayâ€“August 2021, the 2021 Taliban offensive ended the War in Afghanistan one year after the United Statesâ€“Taliban deal.[179]\n",

      "### Geography ###\n",
      "The United States is the world's third-largest country by total area behind Russia and Canada.[d][180][181] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470Â km2).[10][182][183] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[184]\n",
      "The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[185] The Mississippi River System, the world's fourth-longest river system, runs predominantly northâ€“south through the heart of the country. The flat and fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[185]\n",
      "The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300Â m) in Colorado.[186] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[187] In the northwest corner of Arizona, carved by the Colorado River over millions of years, is the Grand Canyon, a steep-sided canyon and popular tourist destination known for its overwhelming visual size and intricate, colorful landscape.\n",
      "The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the State of California,[188] about 84 miles (135Â km) apart.[189] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5Â m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[190] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains, the Yellowstone Caldera, is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[191] In 2021, the United States had 8% of global permanent meadows and pastures and 10% of cropland.[192]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Climate ###\n",
      "With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[193] The western Great Plains are semi-arid.[194] Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii, the southern tip of Florida and U.S. territories in the Caribbean and Pacific are tropical.[195]\n",
      "The United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[196][197] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[198] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[199] The regions considered as the most attractive to the population are the most vulnerable.[200]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Biodiversity and conservation ###\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[202] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[203] and around 91,000 insect species.[204]\n",
      "There are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[205] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[206] primarily in the Western States.[207] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for commercial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[208][209]\n",
      "Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biodiversity, logging and deforestation,[210][211] and climate change.[212][213] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[214] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[215] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[216] In 2024, the U.S. ranked 35th among 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[217]\n",

      "### Government and politics ###\n",
      "The United States is a federal republic of 50 states and a separate federal capital district, Washington, D.C. It also asserts sovereignty over five unincorporated territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[17][218] The U.S. is the world's oldest surviving federation,[219] and its presidential system of national government has been adopted, in whole or in part, by many newly independent states worldwide following their decolonization.[220] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\".[221] The Constitution of the United States serves as the country's supreme legal document.[222]\n",
      "\n",
      "### National government ###\n",
      "Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. It is regulated by a strong system of checks and balances.[223]\n",
      "The three-branch system is known as the presidential system, in contrast to the parliamentary system, where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world imitated this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the Americas.[233]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Political parties ###\n",
      "The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties.[234] Since then, the United States has operated as a de facto two-party system, though the parties in that system have been different at different times.[235] The two main national parties are presently the Democratic and the Republican. The former is perceived as relatively liberal in its political platform while the latter is perceived as relatively conservative.[236]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Subdivisions ###\n",
      "In the American federal system, sovereign powers are shared between two levels of elected government: national and state. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states.[237] States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district containing the U.S. capital, Washington, D.C.[238] The federal district is an administrative division of the federal government.[239] Federally recognized tribes govern 326 Indian reservations.[240]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Foreign relations ###\n",
      "The United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it has the world's second-largest diplomatic corps as of 2024[update]. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[241] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[242] The United States is a member of the G7,[243] G20,[244] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[245] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[246] North Korea,[247] and Bhutan.[248] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[249] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[250] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the Indo-Pacific when the United States joined the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan.[251]\n",
      "The United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[252] and strong ties with Canada,[253] Australia,[254] New Zealand,[255] the Philippines,[256] Japan,[257] South Korea,[258] Israel,[259] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[260] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with countries in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United Statesâ€“Mexicoâ€“Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[261] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[231] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[262] while its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[263][264] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine;[265] it has also provided the country with significant military equipment and other support in response to Russia's 2022 invasion.[266]\n",

      "The president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force.[267] The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[268]\n",
      "The United States spent $916 billion on its military in 2023, which is by far the largest amount of any country, making up 37% of global military spending and accounting for 3.4% of the country's GDP.[269][270] The U.S. possesses 42% of the world's nuclear weaponsâ€”the second-largest share after Russia.[271]\n",
      "The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[272] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[273] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[274]\n",
      "State defense forces (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. SDFs are authorized by state and federal law but are under the command of the state's governor.[275][276][277]\n",
      "They are distinct from the state's National Guard units in that they cannot become federalized entities. A state's National Guard personnel, however, may be federalized under the National Defense Act Amendments of 1933, which created the Guard and provides for the integration of Army National Guard units and personnel into the U.S. Army and (since 1947) the U.S. Air Force.[278]\n",

      "There are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States.[279] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff departments in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[280] State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials,[281] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals of state court decisions.[282]\n",
      "There is no unified \"criminal justice system\" in the United States. The American prison system is largely heterogenous, with thousands of relatively independent systems operating across federal, state, local, and tribal levels. In 2024, \"these systems hold over 1.9 million people in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,323 juvenile correctional facilities, 142 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories.\"[283] Despite disparate systems of confinement, four main institutions dominate: federal prisons, state prisons, local jails, and juvenile correctional facilities.[284] Federal prisons are run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and hold people who have been convicted of federal crimes, including pretrial detainees.[284] State prisons, run by the official department of correction of each state, hold sentenced people serving prison time (usually longer than one year) for felony offenses.[284] Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial; they also hold those serving short sentences (typically under a year).[284] Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local or state governments and serve as longer-term placements for any minor adjudicated as delinquent and ordered by a judge to be confined.[285]\n",
      "In January 2023, the United States had the sixth-highest per capita incarceration rate in the worldâ€”531 people per 100,000 inhabitantsâ€”and the largest prison and jail population in the world, with more than 1.9 million people incarcerated.[283][286][287] An analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed U.S. homicide rates \"were 7 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25 times higher\".[288]\n",

Depending upon the state, this department might also directly operate or supervise other modes of transportation.\n",
      "Aviation law is almost entirely the jurisdiction of the federal government; the Federal Aviation Administration regulates all aspects of civil aviation, air traffic management, certification and compliance, and aviation safety. Vehicle traffic laws, however, are enacted and enforced by state and local authorities, with the exception of roads located on federal property (such as national parks and military bases) or in the unorganized U.S. territories. The United States Coast Guard is the primary enforcer of law and security on U.S. waterways, inland as well as coastal, but economic jurisdiction over coastal tidelands is shared between state and federal governments. The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, totaling 41,009Â km (25,482Â mi).[370]\n",
      "Passenger and freight rail systems, bus systems, water ferries, and dams may be under either public or private ownership and operation. U.S. civilian airlines are all privately owned. Most U.S. airports are owned and operated by local government authorities, and there are also some private airports. The Transportation Security Administration has provided security at most major airports since 2001.\n",
      "Commercial railroads and trains were the dominant mode of transportation in the U.S. until the mid-twentieth century. The introduction of jet airplanes and airports serving the same major routes accelerated a decline in demand for interstate and intercity rail passenger service by the 1960s. The completion of the Interstate Highway System also hastened the sharp curtailment of passenger service by the railroads. These significant developments led to the creation of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, now called Amtrak, by the U.S. federal government in 1971. Amtrak helps to maintain limited intercity rail passenger service in most parts of the country. It serves most major U.S. cities, but outside the Northeast, California, and Illinois it typically runs only a few trains per day. More frequent Amtrak service is available in regional corridors between certain major cities, particularly the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston; between New York City and Albany; in metropolitan Chicago; and in parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. Amtrak does not serve several major U.S. destinations, including Las Vegas and Phoenix, Arizona.\n",

Roads maintained only by the U.S. federal government are generally only found on federal lands (such as national parks) or at federal facilities (like military bases). The Interstate Highway System, with its large, open freeways linking the states, is partly funded by the federal government but owned and maintained by the state government hosting its section of the interstate. Some states fund and build their own large expresswaysâ€”often called \"parkways\" or \"turnpikes\"â€”that generally use tolls to pay for construction and maintenance. Likewise, some privately owned roads may use tolls for this purpose.\n",

Public transit systems serve areas of higher population density where demand is greatest. Many U.S. cities, towns, and suburbs are car-dependent, however, and suburban public transit is less common and service far less frequent. Most U.S. urban areas have some form of public transit, notably city buses, while the largest (e.g. New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, and Portland, Oregon) operate extensive systems that also include subways or light rail.[376] Most public transit service in the United States is run by local governments, but national and regional commuter lines serve major U.S. urban corridors.\n",
      "Personal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[377][378] which operate on a network of 4Â million miles (6.4Â million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest in the world.[379][380] The country's rail transport network, also the longest in the world at 182,412.3Â mi (293,564.2Â km),[381] handles mostly freight.[382][383] Of the world's 50 busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, with the busiest in the U.S. being the Port of Los Angeles.[384]\n",

      "The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[401] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[402][403] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the country's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population.[401] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population. The country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%,[401] and some 574 native tribes are recognized by the federal government.[404] In 2022, the median age of the United States population was 38.9 years.[405]\n",

      "### Language ###\n",
      "While many languages are spoken in the United States, English is by far the most commonly spoken and written.[406] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws, such as U.S. naturalization requirements, standardize English, and most states have declared it the official language.[407] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[408] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[v][409] South Dakota (Sioux),[410] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States.[411] In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[412]\n",
      "According to the American Community Survey (2020),[413] some 245.4 million people in the U.S. age five and older spoke only English at home. About 41.2 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (3.40 million), Tagalog (1.71 million), Vietnamese (1.52 million), Arabic (1.39 million), French (1.18 million), Korean (1.07 million), and Russian (1.04 million). German, spoken by 1 million people at home in 2010, fell to 857,000 total speakers in 2020.[414]\n",

      "The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power or spiritual force, engage in spiritual practices such as prayer, and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[430][431] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally, whereas New England and the Western United States tend to be more secular.[428] Mormonismâ€”a Restorationist movement, whose members migrated westward from Missouri and Illinois under the leadership of Brigham Young in 1847 after the assassination of Joseph Smith[432]â€”remains the predominant religion in Utah to this day.\n",

      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023 (75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women). This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022, and the CDC noted that the new average was largely driven by \"decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes\".[440] Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[441] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[442] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[443] The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other country, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated.[444] The United States is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[445] Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications.

      "### Education ###\n",
      "American primary and secondary education (known in the U.S. as K-12, \"kindergarten through 12th grade\") is decentralized. School systems are operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the U.S. Department of Education. In general, children are required to attend school or an approved homeschool from the age of five or six (kindergarten or first grade) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the 12th grade, the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17.[449] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any other country,[450] an average of $18,614 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2020â€“2021.[451] Among Americans age 25 and older, 92.2% graduated from high school, 62.7% attended some college, 37.7% earned a bachelor's degree, and 14.2% earned a graduate degree.[452] The U.S. literacy rate is near-universal.[180][453] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners of any country, with 411 (having won 413 awards).[454][455]\n",
      "U.S. tertiary or higher education has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[456][457] American higher education is dominated by state university systems, although the country's many private universities and colleges enroll about 20% of all American students. Local community colleges generally offer coursework and degree programs covering the first two years of college study. They often have more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[458]\n",
      "As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and Americans spend more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[459] Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government do not charge tuition and are limited to military personnel and government employees, including: the U.S. service academies, the Naval Postgraduate School, and military staff colleges. Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[460] student loan debt increased by 102% between 2010 and 2020,[461] and exceeded $1.7Â trillion in 2022.[462]\n",

      "### Culture and society ###\n",
      "Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American Creed\" emphasizing consent of the governed, liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[464][465] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[466][467] as well as having a strong work ethic,[468] competitiveness,[469] and voluntary altruism towards others.[470][471][472] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charityâ€”the highest rate in the world by a large margin.[473] The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[474][475] The country has acquired significant hard and soft power through its diplomatic influence, economic power, military alliances, and cultural exports such as American movies, music, video games, sports, and food.[476][477] The influence that the United States exerts on other countries through soft power is referred to as Americanization.[478]\n",
      "Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Europe, Africa, or Asia (the \"Old World\") within the past five centuries.[479] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[480] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture. The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[481][482] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[483][484][485] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[486] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[487][488] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[489]\n",
      "The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities is an agency of the United States federal government that was established in 1965 with the purpose to \"develop and promote a broadly conceived national policy of support for the humanities and the arts in the United States, and for institutions which preserve the cultural heritage of the United States.\"[490] It is composed of four sub-agencies:\n",

      "### Literature ###\n",
      "Colonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and various other Enlightenment philosophers.[502][503] The American Revolutionary Period (1765â€“1783) is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson. Shortly before and after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature.[504][505] An early novel is William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, published in 1791. Writer and critic John Neal in the early- to mid-nineteenth century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture by criticizing predecessors such as Washington Irving for imitating their British counterparts, and by influencing writers such as Edgar Allan Poe,[506] who took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller pioneered the influential Transcendentalism movement;[507][508] Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, was influenced by this movement. The conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired writers, like Harriet Beecher Stowe, and authors of slave narratives, such as Frederick Douglass. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851). Major American poets of the nineteenth century American Renaissance include Walt Whitman, Melville, and Emily Dickinson.[509][510] Mark Twain was the first major American writer to be born in the West. Henry James achieved international recognition with novels like The Portrait of a Lady (1881). As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor.[511][512] Naturalism, regionalism, and realism were the major literary movements of the period.[513][514]\n",
      "While modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures.[515] Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on NÃ©gritude, a philosophy emerging in the 1930s among francophone writers of the African diaspora.[516][517] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[518] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[519][520] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[521] Twelve American laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.[522]\n",

Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles.

      "The United States is well known for its theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[533] By the middle of the 19th century America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[534] The central hub of the American theater scene is the Theater District in Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[535]\n",
      "Many movie and television celebrities have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[536]\n",
      "The Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theater and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances.

      "### Visual arts ###\n",
      "Folk art in colonial America grew out of artisanal craftsmanship in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of high art, which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers.[539] Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of woodworking and primitive sculpture became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of Renaissance styles in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts didâ€”and far longer than those in Western Europe.[491]\n",
      "The Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[540]\n",
      "Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[541]\n",
      "The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[542] The Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest art museum in the United States[543] and the fourth-largest in the world.[544]\n",

      "### Music ###\n",
      "American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, mainland Europe, or Africa.[545] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music.[546] Banjos were brought to America through the slave trade. Minstrel shows incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century.[547][548] The electric guitar, first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll.[549]\n",
      "Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[550] Country music developed in the 1920s,[551] rock and roll in the 1930s,[549] and bluegrass[552] and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[553] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[554] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States in the 1970s.[555]\n",
      "The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022.[556] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[557] Mid-20th-century American pop stars, such as Frank Sinatra[558] and Elvis Presley,[559] became global celebrities and best-selling music artists,[550] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Michael Jackson,[560] Madonna,[561] Whitney Houston,[562] and Mariah Carey,[563] and the early 21st century, such as Eminem,[564] Britney Spears,[565] Lady Gaga,[565] Katy Perry,[565] Taylor Swift and BeyoncÃ©.[566]\n",

Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing; however, sneakers, jeans, T-shirts, and baseball caps are emblematic of American styles.[568] New York, with its fashion week, is considered to be one of the \"Big Four\" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London. A study demonstrated that general proximity to Manhattan's Garment District has been synonymous with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th century.[569]\n",

Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is also metonymous for the American filmmaking industry.[573][574][575] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[576][577] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[578] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[579] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[580]\n",
      "The industry peaked in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[581] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[582][583] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\", or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\",[584] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[585] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[586][587]\n",

      "Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as wheat flour,[588] beef, and milk, to create a distinctive American cuisine.[589][590] New World crops, especially pumpkin, corn, potatoes, and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on Thanksgiving, when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[591]\n",
      "Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, hamburgers, hot dogs, and American pizza derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[592][593][594][595] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and adaptations of Chinese cuisine as well as pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[596] American chefs have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[597][598]\n",
      "The United States restaurant industry was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[599][600] and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[599] It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[601][602] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin star-rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[603] Wine has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico in 1628.[604][605][606] In the modern U.S., wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with California producing 84 percent of all U.S. wine. With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500Â km2) under vine, the United States is the fourth-largest wine-producing country in the world, after Italy, Spain, and France.[607][608]\n",
      "The American fast-food industry developed alongside the nation's car culture.[609] American restaurants developed the drive-in format in the 1920s, which they began to replace with the drive-through format by the 1940s.[610][611] American fast-food restaurant chains, such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin' Donuts and many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[612]\n",

      "### Sports ###\n",
      "The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[613] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[614] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[615] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69Â billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[616]\n",
      "American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[617] the National Football League has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[618] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. \"national sport\" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[619][620]\n",
      "On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[621] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA March Madness tournament and the College Football Playoff are some of the most watched national sporting events.[622] In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[623]\n",
      "Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[624] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,968 medals (1,179 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[625][626][627]\n",
      "In international professional competition, the U.S. men's national soccer team has qualified for eleven World Cups, while the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[628] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[629] The 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup was also hosted by the United States. Its final match was watched by 90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women's sporting event at the time.[630]\n",
